A modern PDF library for TypeScript. Parse, modify, and generate PDFs with a clean, intuitive API.

> **Beta Software**: LibPDF is under active development and APIs may change between minor versions, but we use it in production at [Documenso](https://documenso.com) and consider it ready for real-world use.

> **SignSecure fork**: This package adds OpenPDF-compatible visible signature appearances and is maintained against [LibPDF-js/core](https://github.com/LibPDF-js/core). The original MIT license and attribution are retained.

## Why LibPDF?

LibPDF was born from frustration. At [Documenso](https://documenso.com), we found ourselves wrestling with the JavaScript PDF ecosystem:

- **PDF.js** is excellent for rendering and even has annotation editing — but it requires a browser
- **pdf-lib** has a great API, but chokes on slightly malformed documents
- **pdfkit** only generates, no parsing at all

We kept adding workarounds. A patch here for a malformed xref table. A hack there for an encrypted document. Eventually, we decided to build what we actually needed:

- **Lenient like PDFBox and PDF.js**: opens documents other libraries reject
- **Intuitive like pdf-lib**: clean, TypeScript-first API
- **Complete**: encryption, digital signatures, incremental saves, form filling

## Installation

Configure npm to use GitHub Packages for the SignSecure scope. Set
`GITHUB_PACKAGES_TOKEN` to a GitHub token with `read:packages` permission:

```ini
# .npmrc
@signsecure:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${GITHUB_PACKAGES_TOKEN}
```

```bash
npm install @signsecure/libpdf-core@0.4.1-signsecure.1
# or
bun add @signsecure/libpdf-core@0.4.1-signsecure.1
```

## Quick Start

### Parse an existing PDF

```typescript
import { PDF } from "@signsecure/libpdf-core";

const pdf = await PDF.load(bytes);
const pages = pdf.getPages();

console.log(`${pages.length} pages`);
```

### Open an encrypted PDF

```typescript
const pdf = await PDF.load(bytes, { credentials: "password" });
```

### Fill a form

```typescript
const pdf = await PDF.load(bytes);
const form = pdf.getForm();

form.fill({
  name: "Jane Doe",
  email: "jane@example.com",
  agreed: true,
});

const filled = await pdf.save();
```

### Sign a document

```typescript
import { PDF, P12Signer } from "@signsecure/libpdf-core";

const pdf = await PDF.load(bytes);
const signer = await P12Signer.create(p12Bytes, "password");

const signed = await pdf.sign({
  signer,
  reason: "I approve this document",
});
```

### Merge PDFs

```typescript
const merged = await PDF.merge([pdf1Bytes, pdf2Bytes, pdf3Bytes]);
```

### Draw on a page

```typescript
import { PDF, rgb } from "@signsecure/libpdf-core";

const pdf = PDF.create();
const page = pdf.addPage({ size: "letter" });

page.drawText("Hello, World!", {
  x: 50,
  y: 700,
  fontSize: 24,
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0),
});

page.drawRectangle({
  x: 50,
  y: 600,
  width: 200,
  height: 100,
  color: rgb(0.9, 0.9, 0.9),
  borderColor: rgb(0, 0, 0),
  borderWidth: 1,
});

const output = await pdf.save();
```

## Runtime Support

LibPDF runs everywhere:

- **Node.js** 20+
- **Bun**
- **Browsers** (modern, with Web Crypto)

## Known Limitations

Some features are not yet implemented:

| Feature                     | Status           | Notes                                  |
| --------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Signature verification      | Not implemented  | Signing works; verification is planned |
| TrueType Collections (.ttc) | Not supported    | Extract individual fonts first         |
| JBIG2 image decoding        | Passthrough only | Images preserved but not decoded       |
| JPEG2000 (JPX) decoding     | Passthrough only | Images preserved but not decoded       |
| Certificate encryption      | Not supported    | Password encryption works              |
| JavaScript actions          | Ignored          | Form calculations not executed         |

These limitations are documented to set expectations. Most don't affect typical use cases like form filling, signing, or document manipulation.

## Philosophy

### Be lenient

Real-world PDFs are messy. Export a document through three different tools and you'll get three slightly different interpretations of the spec. LibPDF prioritizes _opening your document_ over strict compliance. When standard parsing fails, we fall back to brute-force recovery, scanning the entire file to rebuild the structure.

### Two API layers

- **High-level**: `PDF`, `PDFPage`, `PDFForm` for common tasks
- **Low-level**: `PdfDict`, `PdfArray`, `PdfStream` for full control
